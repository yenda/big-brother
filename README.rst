Configuration
=============

This projects requires a python version >= 3.4 and Django >= 1.7 to work.


Project layout
==============

The project layout was made in such a way that code is seperated from non-code
files that you typically want to serve in another way (static and media files)
or keep in a different location (like the virtual environment)::

    bigbrother
    |
    +-- env                 -- Virtual environment files.
    |
    +-- src                 -- Container for one or more source directories.
    |   |
    |   +-- bigbrother
    |       |
    |       +-- conf        -- Django settings files.
    |       |
    |       +-- templates   -- Project templates
    |       |
    |       +-- wsgi        -- Default location for wsgi deployment scripts
    |       |
    |       +-- static      -- Default location for project static files
    |       |
    |       +-- ...         -- Project specific applications.
    |
    +-- static              -- Default location for collected static files.
    |
    +-- media               -- Default location for uploaded media files.
    |
    +-- log                 -- All log files generated by the project.
    |
    +-- doc                 -- Documentation source and generated files.
    |
    +-- requirements        -- Project requirements for each type of installation.


Installation
============

New installations (for development or production) should follow the steps
below.

1. Navigate to the location where you want to place your project.

2. Get the code::

    $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/yenda/bigbrother
    $ cd bigbrother

3. Bootstrap the virtual environment and install all required libraries. The
   ``boostrap.py`` script basically sets the proper Django settings file to be
   used::

    $ python bootstrap.py <production|staging|test|development>
    
4. Activate your virtual environment and create the statics and database::

    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ python manage.py collectstatic --link
    $ python manage.py migrate


Developers
----------

Optionally, you can load demo data and extract demo media files::

    $ python manage.py loaddata demo
    $ cd media
    $ tar -xzf demo.tgz

You can now run your installation and point your browser to the address given
by this command::

    $ python src/manage.py runserver

If you are making local, machine specific, changes, add them to 
``src/bigbrother/conf/settings_local.py``. You can base this file on
the example file included in the same directory.


Staging and production
----------------------

Configure your webserver and/or WSGI handler. See: 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/

Note that your wsgi script in ``src/bigbrother/wsgi.py already
points to your staging|production settings.py file. This happens when
bootstrapping your environment.
    
Update installation
===================

When updating an existing installation:

1. Activate the virtual environment::

    $ cd bigbrother
    $ source env/bin/activate

2. Update the code and libraries::

    $ git pull
    $ pip install -r requirements/<production|staging|test|development>.txt
    
3. Update the statics and database::

    $ python manage.py collectstatic --link
    $ python manage.py migrate
